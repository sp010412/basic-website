        <p>
            Find New York to be full of opportunities and a great place to persue your dreams.
            The city is filled with energy. There is no other city on this planet with great energy that
            would compete with New York.
            Another thing I love about the city is the incredible diversity. You'll see all sorts of
            people
            from all over the world.
