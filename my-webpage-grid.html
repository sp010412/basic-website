                <p> Find New York to be full of opportunities and a great place to persue your dreams.
                    The city is filled with energy. There is no other city on this planet with great energy that
                    would compete with New York.
                    Another thing I love about the city is the incredible diversity. You'll see all sorts of
                    people
                    from all over the world.
